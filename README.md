# Cryptoprojects

A repository of C programs which all serve a different cryptographic purpose. Currently available:
    * arithmetic.c: Performs arithmetic encoding of strings, and arithmetic decoding of floats.

    * frequencyAnalyser.c: outputs a frequency analysis (English) of the given text. Can also provide a caesar cipher decryption based on this.

    * vigenere.c: a program to brute force a solution to a vigenere cipher

    * rands.c: outputs a sequence of random numbers between 0 and 14 (can be adjusted)
