# Cryptoprojects

A repository of C programs which all serve a different cryptographic purpose. Currently available:\n
    \t- arithmetic.c: Performs arithmetic encoding of strings, and arithmetic decoding of floats.\n
    \t- frequencyAnalyser.c: outputs a frequency analysis (English) of the given text. Can also provide a caesar cipher decryption based on this.\n
    \t- vigenere.c: a program to brute force a solution to a vigenere cipher\n
    \t- rands.c: outputs a sequence of random numbers between 0 and 14 (can be adjusted)
